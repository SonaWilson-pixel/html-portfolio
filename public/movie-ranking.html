<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Marley & Me</h3>

This movie is my all time favourite as I love dogs and this movie is about dogs

<h3>Bangalore Days</h3> 

The songs, story, character all of this makes this movie my all time favourite.

<h3>Ayyapanum Koshiyum</h3>

Even though its 3 hours long movie, this movie doesnt fail to entertain and deliver a world class acting by Prithviraj and Biju Menon.
